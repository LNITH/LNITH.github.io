<p>Last Name in the Hat is comprised of avid gamers who have all dreamed of producing their own video game. In April 2014, the first members of Last Name in the Hat banded together to make that dream a reality. Soon the basic story, universe, and characters of Kuraz were created. Slowly but surely, more artists, writers, and programmers joined the team, and over the past the months, the game’s concept has truly begun to take form.</p>

<p>While we still have a lot of work left to do before this game is complete, much less has the polish that we want it to have, we’re confident that with your support we can produce a game that we feel would actually be worthy of being released to the public.</p>
