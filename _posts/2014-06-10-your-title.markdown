<h2 class="section-heading">Section Heading with h2 Tags</h2>

<blockquote>If you want to have some intented and quoted text use these blockquote tags.</blockquote>

<!-- This is what linking a photo in your post looks like -->
<a href="#">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="Post Sample Image">
</a>
<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
<!-- This span tag is if you want to subtitle your picture -->
