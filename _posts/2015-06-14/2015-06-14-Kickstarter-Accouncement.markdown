<p>Hey all, sadly we had some unexpected roadblocks this past week and wont be able to launch quite on time. Everything should be sorted out relatively soon so the new launch date is the 24th of June now.</p>

<p>With that, I figured I'd take a moment and talk a little bit about the library that we're using to produce the game, "Cocos 2D-X".</p>

<p>Cocos is a C++ library and compiler that allows a programmer to write a single set of code, and then have it run on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. Its really handy and convient since I would otherwise need to write up code in C++, Java, and Objective C. Not necessarilly hard, but it would be a ton of extra work that could otherwise be spent refining and tweaking the game to be just right.</p>

<p>However that isn't to say its perfect. The original developers were based in China, and thus parts of the documentation are either hastily or poorly explained. Which is frustrating when you need to understand what functions a particular class has and what they do, only to have stub articles in place of actual information. Despite that, I've been making decent progress on understanding and working with the library and things are moving along.</p>

<p>Once we get the Kickstarter rolling we'll be putting up a blog post or two every week showcasing the main characters of our story, so keep your eyes out, and we'll see you all very soon!</p>
