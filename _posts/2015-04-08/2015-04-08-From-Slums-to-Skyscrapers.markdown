<p>Hello all! This is Annamarie Mickey, the lead artist on the Last Name in a Hat team! Or head character designer. Or lead concept artist. Take your pick, I wear a lot of hats around these parts (pun intended).</p>

<p>I was brought on the team sometime during the summer. It really only took one Skype call with Cody, our team leader, to pique my interest in the story of “Kuraz.” We’ve all seen our share of space games, but what I love about “Kuraz”—and what influenced the concepts and designs I’ve pursued with this game—are the people and society of Kuraz itself.</p>

<p>Some incredible technology exists in this future galaxy. Terraforming, highly advanced weapons, space ships… and people with the money to buy and use it all. Most of those people, though, don’t live on Kuraz. And those that do sit up in high skyscrapers with beautiful, colorful glass domes that keep the dirt and grime of the planet out of sight and out of mind.</p>

<p>Unlike the rich entrepreneurs and corrupt corporations, our story buries itself deep into that gritty dust and dirt, and the people who have to be as tough as nails to live in it. While designing the characters you’ll meet over the course of the game, I realized that these people—the true heart of the planet—have barely glimpsed the technology that created the colony on Kuraz. Brief glimpses of ships in the sky heading towards the wealthy end of the city, failed corporate attempts to clean up the slums, bits and pieces of scavenged weapons… these are the only experiences of the future’s “incredible technology” for most Kuraz citizens. And it’s hardly impressive.</p>

<p>Out of sight, out of mind.</p>

<p>What sort of people are molded from such an environment? What sort of streets do they walk down? What kind of sky do they view every day? What is the view from the patched windows in their tiny apartments and houses nestled between warehouses and tucked tight in the slums, where gangs and mercenary groups have control of the undercity?</p>

<p>And what view are they missing?</p>

<p>These are a lot of the questions I asked myself while designing the world of Kuraz (both the planet and the story), and exploring them has been both challenging and a lot of fun. And as the Last Name in a Hat team brings the art, story, music, and gameplay together, I hope you’re as eager as I have been to explore “Kuraz”!</p>
