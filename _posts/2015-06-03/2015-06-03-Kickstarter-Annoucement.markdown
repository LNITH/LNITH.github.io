<p>Thats right, we have a date for the Kickstarter! Despite life getting in and mucking everything up a bunch, we’re still pushing forward and are insanely excited to reach a point that we can confidently release the Kickstarter!</p>

<p>We’re still hard at work at trying to finish an early alpha of the game that we could release for people to playtest during the Kickstarter campaign. The goal of this build will be demonstrating the main gameplay elements in the tactical portion of the game, cover, shields, flanking, and other such elements. Given this will be liable to change as we will continue fine-tuning the game, but the core-elements shall remain there.</p>

<p>So tell your friends, family, and your dog about this Kickstarter, as we’ll be seeing you all very shortly!</p>
