<p>So last time on our devblog here we gave a quick overview of some of the key mechanics of <i>Kuraz</i>. Today, we’re going to share just a set-up of the story you’ll be experiencing throughout the game.</p>

<p><i>Kuraz</i> takes place several hundred years in the future on the game’s titular planet. Kuraz is ignored when the colonization rush happens due to being very inhospitable. The water on the planet is somewhat acidic and thusly there is very little vegetation (if any) on the planet. It is only when a group of colonists - seeking to live a life with literally zero government interference - use the planet as a chance to truly live out that dream. Without the funds to have the planet properly terraformed, these colonists make due with what resources they could scrape together. They discovered Kuraz’s subterranean water reservoirs, purified as it seeped through the planet’s soil (one of the few uses for Kuraz’s vast amounts of dirt and sand).  </p>

<p>And this discovery alone made Kuraz… not hospitable, perhaps, but livable. Over the course of three decades, Kuraz gains renown for the freedoms its inhabitants enjoyed, and that’s when corporations take interest. In the coming decades, several off-world corporations begin helping several corporations native to the planet grow, and generally improving the already good life on Kuraz. However, the drive for greater profits combined with the lack of any oversight, drives some corporations to begin ethically questionable practices. While only minor things at first (company script instead of money as an example) things quickly became much worse, ranging from crimes against humanity to the funding of pirates and smugglers in the nearby solar systems.With a number of corporations vying for power, waging small wars with their private armies, one corporation emerges as the “victor”, The Anderson Corporation.</p>

<p>The Anderson Corporation, initially formed on Kuraz, finds a large amount of off-world investors for it to get its operations started off. After the decline of ethical standards on Kuraz, The Anderson Corporation maintains good public relations by only practicing questionable ethics on opposing corporations rather than their own workers - a CEO assassination, bombing key facilities, things that crippled their opponents, but left the working man safe. With this dominance, Anderson begins delving into “criminal” activities, actively funding pirate and smuggling operations in the nearby solar systems. It’s after this that nearby planets who are members of Sol-Sys requested the federation take action. Sol-Sys is a federation of planets that formed after the initial colonization rush. The main purpose of this federation is to guarantee basic human rights since many planets are breeding grounds for all sorts of exploitation. In return for being a member and following the guidelines required, member’s interests would be protected as well. With the recent outbreak of piracy, Sol-Sys sends one of its best agents, a man by the codename “Dart”, to cripple the Anderson Corporation from the inside and avoid a full-scale war.</p>

<p>And this, is where our story begins.</p>
