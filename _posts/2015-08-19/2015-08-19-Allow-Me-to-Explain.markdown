<p>Cody here. Just wanted to say this devblog is gonna be a bit different than the previous ones as you'll notice in a moment here.</p>

<p>I first off want to apologize for the lack of updates and content concerning Kuraz and the Kickstarter since June. For some time, I've been struggling with fear, doubt, depression, whatever it may be, and when we failed to launch the Kickstarter on the said date it just made things a ton worse. I'm still having trouble forgiving myself for the mistakes that happened, but I finally woke up enough to realize that I can't keep living in the past when I still believe in this project. So my sincerest apologies to all of you, my team included. Time to get back on track and get this project launched.</p>

<p>Now, to actually discuss the project rather than myself. We are once again nearing having the Kickstarter ready for launch (more on a specific date in the next devblog) as the paperwork and Kickstarter video have been just about finished. With me getting back on track to work on more coding, there will be a pre-alpha demo in the near future, hopefully coinciding with the launch of the Kickstarter as well.</p>

<p>I wish I had some more updates for you guys, but sadly there isn't much more to say than what I have said. Know this though, this project is not dead and I'll be damned if I let it die because I wasn't feeling in the mood to work. My apologies once again, and thank you for your continued support.</p>
